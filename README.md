# Node.js Back-End 

This is a small Node.js back-end application that utilizes various techniques commonly used in back-end development. These include internationalization (i18), validation, JWT authentication, Sequelize ORM, SQLite3 database, logger, error handler, cross-env, middleware, project structure, relational model, response body, GitHub Actions, and database migration.

## Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nodejs-backend.git`
2.  Navigate to the project directory using `cd nodejs-backend`
3.  Install the required dependencies using `npm install`
4.  Start the application using `npm start`

## Usage

The back-end application exposes several endpoints for various operations. These include:

-   `/articles` - GET, POST, DELELE PUT endpoints for managing articles
-   `/users` - GET, POST, DELELE PUT endpoints for managing users

The application utilizes i18 for internationalization, JWT for authentication, and Sequelize for managing the SQLite3 database. It also has middleware for handling errors and response body structure.

## Features

The back-end application has the following features:

-   Internationalization (i18) support
-   Validation for user input
-   JWT authentication for user management
-   Sequelize ORM for managing the SQLite3 database
-   Logger for logging requests and responses
-   Error handler middleware for handling errors
-   Cross-env for environment variable management
-   Project structure for easy maintenance
-   Relational model for data storage
-   Response body structure middleware for standardizing response format
-   Github Actions for automated testing and deployment
-   Database migration for easy database schema updates
